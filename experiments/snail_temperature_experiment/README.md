Temperature experiment: trial 1
========

Aim
------------
study the effect of change in temperature on the heart rate of snails

Null hypothesis: temperature does not affect heart rate


Materials
-------------
* 5 snails
* Snail backpack (heart rate and temperature monitor)
* Arduino UNO + data recording device
* one snail per box
* incubator at 40C
* empty snail box
* ice box


Protocol
-----------
* set the incubator at 40C
* close the aperture of the snail shell using tissue and tape
* install snail backpack on 1 snail with superglue
* put the empty snail box in the icebox
* place the snail inside the snailbox and put the apparatus in the incubator
* measure heartrate and temperature of the snail while it is inside the shell
* stop the measurement when the temperature reaches 39-40C


Snail backpack protocol
------------------------
Heart rate sensor:
* use strong white light to mark the position of the LED and the light sensor
* attach LED lights x3 using superglue
* attach the black frame using superglue
* insert light sensor into the blackframe and test

Temperature sensor:
* glue temperature sensor to the shell

Removal of snail_backpack
* use 50% acetone solution
* submerge the LED light for a minute and carefully detach them from the shell
* repeat same procedure for the temperature sensor and the light sensor
